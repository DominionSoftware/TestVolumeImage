# TestVolumeImage
Test vtk.js image volume
This code intends to create a volume with an empty vtkimage. There is a color transfer function that
defines 0 as blue, 100 as red and 1000 as green.

There is a button that lets you add slices to the empty volume, even numbered z slices with be red and odd numbered will be blue.
This example currently does not work - the volume dissapears on the first mouse event.
